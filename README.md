## Local Installation

You'll need to install .NET Core 5.0.0 located [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0). Make sure Visual Studio Code is closed when you run the installation.

You'll also need to install MySQL located [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/). You can just run through the 'developer' version of the installer. 

## Usage

Select 'Run' from the Visual Studio Code toolbar. You should see the project begin to restore and the localhost URLs will show in the terminal when it's completed. Navigate to these URLs to bring up the website.
